Planck - Pomodoro Technique Application
=======================================

From Wikipedia:

    The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco
    Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down periods
    of work into 25-minute intervals called "pomodori" (from the Italian word
    pomodoro for "tomato"), separated by short breaks.

Features:

* Configurable. Set pomodoro and break durations

* History. Provide a name for each task, view tasks from Today, Yesterday,
  Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days or All Time.

* Statistics. Counts and displays the number of tasks, the total duration and
  breaks.

* Intuitive. Data is auto-saved in a simple mysql database

Please feel free to add features or fix issues.
